####About the game:
  This is a game about translation. As the game starts, it asks how many words do you want to try to translate from portuguese to english.
  Next, it pops random words in portuguese and the user is asked to translate them. The user has only one chance, if it is correct one point
  is earned and if it is wrong one point is lost. After each attempt, a message is shown to notify if it was a wrong or correct answer. When
  all rounds are over, the program outputs a message to notify the score.
